# Spartan Fitness

This project was created with the intent to learn about the following topics:
- Domain Driven Design (DDD)
  - Aggregates
  - Entities
  - Value Objects
- Clean Architecture 
- CQRS

The project uses `.NET 6` in combination with `ASP.NET Core` and `Entity Framework Core 6`

While working on this project I used and learned how to use a number of libraries:
- ErrorOr (Error handling)
- MediatR (CQRS)
- FluentValidation (Application layer validation)
- Mapster (Object mapping)
- EntityFrameworkCore (ORM)
- Swagger (OpenAPI documentation)
